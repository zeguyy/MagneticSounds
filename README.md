<sub>Note: This is a VERY large library of music content. An abundance of storage is recommended. Your network connection speed, the number of concurrent downloads, the number of seeders, and several other factors can affect the download speed. Speeds will fluctuate over time, somewhat randomly. This is unavoidable due to the nature of how P2P connections work.</sub>

### ATTENTION: It is *highly recommended* that a VPN is used whilst operating this software. Unless you know _exactly_ what you are doing, be cautious. Use a VPN. <sub>(ProtonVPN is ideal, however it isn't free.)</sub>
